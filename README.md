# Dissertation Project: Virtual 3D Weapon Assembly and Usage in VR
This project was completed using Unity and C# for the final year project component of my degree from the University of Sheffield under supervision from Dr Steve Maddock.

Using a VR headset and controllers the player is tasked with assembling weapons from their constituent parts.  Once completed they can then use the weapon again a set of targets or enemies.

This project involved the use of 3D math for calculating assembly connections between parts, reccursive graph searching algorithms to monitor sub-assemblies, object searching using raycasts and innovative designs for user interfaces in VR.

# Sheff Jam 7 Winning Game: Asymetrical Multiplayer City Builder/Dodging Runner
I was part of the team that produced the winning game for Sheff Jam 7, a annual game jam competition open to University of Sheffield students.

It uses a node.js server, javascript and html to allow for two players to play online with each other playing seperate roles with different mechanics but still affecting the same game.

I was responsible for the initial game design, creating all of the music and the artwork, parts of the backend server work and the city building (human) game.

# Internet of Things: Wireless Robot
This project used C++ and an ESP32 to remotely control the robot using a browser application that was connected to to a hotspot that the ESP32 was hosting.
