# Sheff Jam 7 Winning Game: Asymetrical Multiplayer City Builder/Dodging Runner
I was part of the team that produced the winning game for Sheff Jam 7, a annual game jam competition open to University of Sheffield students.  It uses a node.js server, javascript and html to allow for two players to play online with each other playing seperate roles with different mechanics but still affecting the same game.
I was responsible for the initial game design, creating all of the music and the artwork, parts of the backend server work and the city building (human) game.
