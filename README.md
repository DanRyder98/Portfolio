## Dissertation Project: Virtual 3D Weapon Assembly and Usage in VR (2019/20)
This project was completed using Unity and C# for the final year project component of my degree from the University of Sheffield under supervision from Dr Steve Maddock.

Using a VR headset and controllers the player is tasked with assembling weapons from their constituent parts.  Once completed they can use the weapon again a set of targets or enemies.

This project involved the use of 3D math for calculating assembly connections between parts, recursive graph searching algorithms to monitor sub-assemblies, object searching using raycasts and innovative designs for user interfaces in VR.

## Sheff Jam 7 Winning Game: Asymmetrical Multiplayer City Builder/Dodging Runner (2020)
I was part of the team that produced the winning game for Sheff Jam 7, an annual 48 hour game jam competition open to University of Sheffield students.

The game uses a node.js server, javascript and html to allow for two players to play online with each other playing seperate roles with different mechanics but still affecting the same game.

I was responsible for the initial game design, creating all of the music and the artwork, parts of the backend server work and the city building (human) game.

## Internet of Things 3rd Year Module: Wireless Robot (2019)
This project used C++ and an ESP32 to remotely control the robot using a browser application that was connected to to a hotspot that the ESP32 was hosting.

## Engineering You're Hired Winning Project: Sea Plough
Engineering Youâ€™re Hired is a week long full time project in which you and a group of engineers all from different disciplines work together to come up with a solution to an engineering problem.  

When tasked with reducing plastic pollution we proposed a sea plough to be deployed in the great pacific garbage patch.  

After winning the professionalism and best proposal award on the Wednesday for our initial presentation I worked on a 3D interactable demo of what a sea plough might look like using the Unity game engine and C#.

The boat responds to the waves using vertex normals to calculate forces to be applied, and the boat can be driven from a 3rd person and 1st person view.

Showing this demo and presenting the solution to an industry expert we won the award for the best solution.

## A-Level Project: Local Multiplayer 2D Archery Game (2015/16)
This game was made for my A-level in computing in Unity using C#.  With controller support it lets up to four players move and jump around a level trying to shoot each other with arrows.  

It is a physics based game and also has a quiz component that lets the player gain powerups by answering questions correctly.
